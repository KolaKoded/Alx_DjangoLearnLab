# The author field in the BookSerializer is a nested serializer that uses the AuthorSerializer to 
# handle the relationship between the Book and Author models. This means that whenever you serialize a Book,
# the related Author information will also be serialized as part of the Book object. For example, the author's 
# name will be included in the serialized response for a book.
